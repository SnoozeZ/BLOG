##Discovering Multi-connection Bridging Rule in Database
###Description
A Multi-connection Bridging Rule (MCBR) is a sequence of connections and each connection is a rule whose antecedent and consequent belong to different conceptual classes. MCBR can capture interclass information among different conceptual classes, at the same time the relationship of items within an identical class. It can cater for various application scenarios such as group-based criminal detecting and correlation detecting in bioinformatics. In this paper, we proposed an approach to discovering interesting MCBRs in database based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM). By presenting data in HMMs, we can estimate the interestingness of a connection simultaneously considering the topological information and association relation. The semi-Markov Random Walk technique and all-confidence are adopted to evaluate the interestingness of a MCBR. Considering that a MCBR is a sequence of connections, the problem of finding the most interesting MCBR is then transformed into the task of finding the most likely sequence of pairs of two hidden states in HMMs. A viterbi based algorithm, V-Bridge, is proposed to mine MCBRs in database. We conduct experiments on synthetic data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

##Cross-layers Evolution of Opinions: Viral Marketing in Multiplex Social Networks

###Description
The inner dynamics of the multiple channels for information diffusion - i.e., online social networks and face-to-face communication, - plays a fundamental role in the individual opinion of an innovation in viral marketing. In the namely multiplex social networks, the agent’s opinion is evolved across multiple channels because of the cross-layers propagation of related information and the diverse diffusion efficiencies of the conjoint layers. However, much emphasis has been put on the effect of the structural feature of a simplex network and the impact of opinion evolution in multiple channels has largely been ignored. Here, we propose a novel agent-based diffusion model to capture the cross-layers evolution of opinions in viral marketing . By theoretical studies and extensive simulations, we reveal the coupling relationship between the diffusion of an innovation and the consensus formation of different distributions of initial opinions. It is found that  the consensus formation indicates the termination of the diffusion dynamics in multiplex networks  and determines the final rate of the adoption. In conclusion, we think that the concept of cross-layers evolution of opinions may provide new insights into further study of viral marketing in multiplex networks.

##New Models for Opinion Evolution in the Social Networks

###Description
In this paper, we study opinion dynamics in social networks and present a new strategy to control the invasive opinion. A developed continuous-opinion evolution model is proposed to describe the mechanism of making decision in closed community. Two basic strategies of evolution are determined and some basic features of our new model are analyzed. We study the different invasive strategies. It is shown using via Monte Carlo simulations our new model shows different invulnerability with traditional model. Node degree and cohesion in invasive small-world community plays less significant role when the evolution of opinion is continues rather than dichotomous. Using simulation, we find some Influential Nodes can affect the outcome dramatically, while these Influential Nodes are sensitive to their node degree and the evolution weight. Thus, we develop invasive control strategy based on these features.
