##Discovering Multi-connection Bridging Rule in Database
###Description
In this project, we proposed a new kind of association rule. This new association rule can find the correalation between different conceptual classes of items. While this new rule looks like a visual "bridge" between classes and one such rule can contains more than one connection, we call it multi-connection bridging rule. 

In addition, we devise a algorithm based on Hidden Markov Models(HMMs) and dynamic programming to discover multi-connection bridging rule in databases.

The figure on the left shows the Hidden Markov Models(HMMs). Two states in  different classes jointly emit an observation at a certain probability.
The figure on the right shows the  procedure of the multi-connection bridging rule mining algorithm.

##New Models for Opinion Evolution in the Social Networks

###Description
In this paper, we study opinion dynamics in social networks and present a new strategy to control the invasive opinion. A developed continuous-opinion evolution model is proposed to describe the mechanism of making decision in closed community. Two basic strategies of evolution are determined and some basic features of our new model are analyzed. We study the different invasive strategies. It is shown using via Monte Carlo simulations our new model shows different invulnerability with traditional model. Node degree and cohesion in invasive small-world community plays less significant role when the evolution of opinion is continues rather than dichotomous. Using simulation, we find some Influential Nodes can affect the outcome dramatically, while these Influential Nodes are sensitive to their node degree and the evolution weight. Thus, we develop invasive control strategy based on these features.
