Here are some tools I wrote for some common tasks.  

* [QiShell - A simple shell implementation written in C.](https://github.com/SnoozeZ/QiShell/blob/master/QiShell.c)
* [Clustering networks based on its betweenness.](https://github.com/SnoozeZ/code-warehouse/blob/master/pyNetworkCluster/networkCluster.py)
* [Automatically register courses in SEU's course registration system.](https://github.com/SnoozeZ/seu-jwc-fker/blob/master/seu_jwc_fker.py)

Here are some related materials (Most in .pdf, .doc and .ppt format).  

* [The experiment report of the *operating system course design*.](http://www.wqzhang.com/materials/Report_of_Operating_System_Course_Design.zip)
