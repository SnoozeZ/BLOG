This is a personal blog of Weiqi Zhang(It's me :-P). I'll aperiodically post my thoughts and ideas, and something interesting here.

I adopt *Pelican*, a really cool static site generator written in python, to produce the static files of this site and run it on the Github's server(thanks to the *Github Pages* project).  
I finally chose this mechanism, after trying lots of alternatives:

* *WordPress*: nice but too bloated.  
* *Flask*: time-consuming to maintain it.
* *Google App Engine*: costly if exceed the free traffic.
* *Sina App Eagine*: not elegant enough. 
* *Openshift*: a very good free PaaS, but a bit slow when visit it in China.  
* *My own VPS*: I'm afraid the GFW will shield it, because I set up a VPN on it.
